# text-search-php
Simple application to Search a string in php files inside a folder and sub folders. I am using python and php for this.


For this code to work you need to install python in your system.
and then copy this files to web accessible folder.
after that 
go to index.php , say: 
http://localhost/text-search-php/index.php

this will open a page with two input boxes give info like this :

1. give folder path like  :-  C:\xampp\htdocs\appname
2. give the search string 

Thats it. enjoy!!
